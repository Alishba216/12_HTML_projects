            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the vast network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data with each other over the internet. This technology enables everyday objects—ranging from household appliances to industrial machinery—to collect, analyze, and share data, transforming the way we live and work. With IoT, smart homes can automate lighting and temperature control, while smart cities can optimize traffic flow and energy usage. The potential applications are limitless, spanning healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and beyond. As IoT continues to evolve, it promises to enhance efficiency, improve decision-making, and create more sustainable environments, fundamentally changing our interaction with the world around us.</p>
